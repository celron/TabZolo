{"name":"Tabzolo","tagline":"Fighting against multi-tab ADD","body":"## How it works?\r\n\r\nTabZolo aims to be as simple to use as possible. Once installed, just click the TabZolo icon and it will `hide` all your inactive tabs and windows leaving you with your current tab to work with. TabZolo will prevent you from opening other tabs or windows while enabled. \r\n\r\nGo from:\r\n\r\n![Too Many Tabs](Insert image url here)\r\n\r\nTo\r\n\r\n![One Tab](Insert Image url here)\r\n\r\n### What if I want my tabs back?\r\n\r\nSimply disable TabZolo by clicking the icon and all your original tabs and windows will be restored back.\r\n\r\n### Why would you make such **EVIL** extension?\r\n\r\nDavid's main motivation was to gain focus on one thing only and felt it would be nice to mess around with `Chrome extensions` to solve that pet peeve. Leo was intrigued with the project and decided to jump to the project to improve his skills. \r\n \r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nDavid Small - [Github](https://github.com/dasmall) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrdazm)\r\n\r\nLeo Correa  - [Github](https://github.com/Tonkpils) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/__leocorrea)\r\n","google":"UA-42411680-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
